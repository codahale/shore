Shore
=====

*What makes Jersey fun.*

Shore is a web application framework which ties together
[Jersey](https://jersey.dev.java.net/), [Hibernate](https://www.hibernate.org/),
and [Guice](http://code.google.com/p/google-guice/) into an awesome foundation
for data-backed, RESTful web services in Java.
